# **App Name**: WeldEase Planner

## Core Features:

- Coverage Calculation: Calculates the average coverage length per welding rod based on the pipe length and total number of rods.
- Spacing Plan Generation: Generates a table displaying the start and end points for each welding rod on the pipe, ensuring even spacing.
- Unit Conversion: Dynamically converts input units (meter, cm, mm) to ensure consistent calculations and output.
- Interactive Chart Display: Displays a graphical bar chart showing the pipe divided into sections, visually representing each rod's coverage area (Optional).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to represent precision and reliability, evoking associations of engineering and technical expertise.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD) creates a clean and professional backdrop without distracting from the numerical and table content.
- Accent color: A vivid orange (#FF9800) provides highlights for critical values and calls to action, standing apart clearly from the primary and background colors.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will be used for both headers and body text due to its clean, readable design and suitability for technical content.
- Table: Use clear, well-defined table borders and alternating row colors to improve readability of the spacing plan.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent units of measurement (mm, cm, m) and welding rods.
